YTWatcher Crack by cssqp / Software for earning money on YouTube / Софт по заработку на YouTube

greetings!
First, I would like to say that the software is not a loot button.
When buying software, you must understand what you are doing.

Let me first show you the results that the software shows, and only then tell you how it works.

Let's take the channel that we brought to monetization in 4 days.

As you can see, before the software, the channel was completely empty, and on the first day of the software launch, we received 20,000+ live views and 2800 hours of video viewing.

The second stream gave us 15,000+ views and 2100 hours of video views.

We also received +561 live subscribers.
On average, we signed up 1000+ people per day.

The software led to the first places in the search:

SCREEN

Wherever it is written 10+ means that we are in 1-3 place in the output, the VIDIQ plugin shows a little wrong as it is correct.

We have received more than 800,000 impressions icons.

And the channel was approved for monetization:

At the moment, my coder and I have a grid of more than 30 channels, with a total income of 6562$ per month (for two).

How to monetize this business?

First, you can sell channels.
Such channels cost from 52$ to 262$, and given the fact that the channels are displayed on the coin using software for 2-5 days, this is a good income.
The software works in a multi-stream, so you can output at least 10 channels to the coin at a time.

Secondly, you can make fake donations.
This is not an honest type of earnings, but according to our tests, it brought from 300 to 2000 rubles a day.
If you do this en masse, you will again get a good income.

Third, you can pour traffic to your sites or FOS (file sharing sites).
Thus, you will receive money for each download of your file, and they pay from 3 to 50 rubles (depending on the GEO).)
If you do traffic on Zabugor, you can earn $ 200-300 per day.


There are a lot of ways to earn money, because as you know, traffic = money.


How does the software work?

Of course, this is intellectual property and I will not tell you the logic of the software 100%, but I can quite imagine the basics.

The software does not work like a regular bot cheat, it goes to the requests (tags) from your video, due to which YouTube begins to lift you up on these very tags.
There is also an additional cheat of viewers from the software, which YouTube considers not bots, but advertising views (this is the answer to the question " can I get a ban?").
The software itself adapts to the necessary transitions by tags, which is why you get to the first positions first on small queries, and then on large ones.


Which is very convenient, we did 90% of the work in the software for you.
Setting up the software is as simple as possible and does not require any skills.
Even my daughter can handle it :)

I repeat once again, the software is not a loot button, you need to work here.

Price:

$ 25 - 2 months of software
